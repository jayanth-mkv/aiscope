# Set up AIScope

Check `aiscope --version` before installing. AIScope is a native Rust CLI; running a released binary does not require Rust, Python, Node.js, an account, or an API key.

Use the current release at https://github.com/Jayanth-MKV/aiscope/releases/latest. Match the OS and CPU: Windows x86_64, macOS x86_64/ARM64, or Linux x86_64/ARM64 with glibc. Download the archive and its `.sha256` file from the same release, compare SHA-256 before extracting, then place the executable in a user-writable directory on PATH. Do not silently install an incompatible architecture or assume Linux musl support.

If Cargo is available, the alternative is `cargo install aiscope --version 0.1.1 --locked`. A source build requires Rust and a platform linker; consult the repository's installation guide if it fails. Do not replace the user's Rust toolchain to resolve a build failure without agreement.

For standalone skills, use the published repository with the skills CLI:

```sh
npx --yes skills add Jayanth-MKV/aiscope --skill aiscope-setup aiscope --agent codex --copy --yes
```

Replace `codex` with the current agent's identifier. Default to project scope; use `--global` only if the user requests it. If Node.js is unavailable, copy just the two skill directories from the repository's `skills/` folder to the current agent's supported skills directory. Do not overwrite an existing skill without checking it. A plugin already supplies both skills, so skip a duplicate standalone installation.

Verify with `aiscope --version`, then run `aiscope --specific --json .` from the target project. Parse stdout as JSON and confirm its `root` matches the intended directory. Do not launch the TUI or watch mode during setup. Explain scan coverage and any returned conflicts; leave instruction files unchanged unless changes were requested. User-wide instructions require the explicit `--user` opt-in.

npm/PyPI launchers are not published for this project yet. The unrelated npm package named `aiscope` is not this tool.
